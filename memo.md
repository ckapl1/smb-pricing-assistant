## Memo

I relied on a mix of AI coding tools, prompt iteration, and lots of trial and error to create a functional prototype that allows small businesses to price their products with AI insights on their competition. This memo will describe how I used AI, why I used it, and the risks I considered.  I used three main tools throughout the process, Cursor AI, Google AI Studio, and ChatGPT. Cursor was where I did most of the development. I started in Google AI Studio just to get a quick idea of what I wanted and build and then used it for its Gemini API key.  ChatGPT served as a support system, as I used it to help interpret certain Cursor commands and bugs I did not understand. 

For the UI I told cursor to emulate Superhuman but eventually chose a Stripe-style layout instead due its simplicity and cleaner look.  I played around with UI a lot until I finally got what I wanted. I dislike how Cursor uses the same UI for all its projects and requires very specific prompting to fix. 

AI accelerated the build time dramatically. As you know, I have very little experience coding and never did any sort of "vibe coding" before the class. I now feel if I have an Idea, I can turn it into a low-fidelity prototype. However, I do recognize the limitations. Prompting needs to be very specific, and I need to keep a close eye on security issues. When I first pushed my project to git, it included my API key, which I quickly learned was unsafe. I then used GitHub secrets, to hide the key, and not hardcode it into the repository. AI helped me implement this but did not warn of the security risks of leaving my API key public. Showing AI is a powerful tool but still requires the logic and critical thinking skills of the user. 

The main AI feature in my product focuses on pulling competitor pricing information from online sources like business websites and menus and using that information to help suggest pricing. I chose this feature because pricing is usually one of the hardest decisions for small businesses, and it often requires manually checking a lot of different sites to see what competitors are charging. AI made sense here because it can speed up that research process and summarize information that would otherwise take a lot of time to gather. I chose this feature over other possible AI features because it felt realistic given the scope of the project and my own experience level. More advanced features like automatic price changes, demand forecasting, or predictive analytics would require much more data and technical infrastructure. Instead, I focused on using AI as a research and reasoning tool rather than something that makes final decisions. I also intentionally kept the feature limited. The AI pulls publicly available competitor information and provides guidance, but it does not automatically set prices. The output is meant to help the user think through their pricing, not blindly follow what the AI suggests. This made the tool easier to build and easier to trust. This feature connects directly to the core goal of the product, which is helping small business owners make better pricing decisions with less effort. At the same time, it is not a complete solution. The AI depends on online information that may not always be perfect, and it does not account for internal business data like costs or sales trends. Being clear about those limitations was important so the tool does not feel misleading.

There were several risks and trade-offs I had to think about while building this project, especially around security, privacy, and trust. The biggest issue I ran into was accidentally pushing my API key to GitHub early on, which I quickly learned was unsafe. I fixed this by using GitHub Secrets instead of hardcoding the key. AI helped me apply the fix, but it did not warn me about the risk, which showed me that AI still requires user awareness and critical thinking.

Because this was a prototype, I chose not to store any user data. Inputs are used only to generate results and are not saved. This limited functionality, but it reduced privacy concerns. I also considered bias and fairness, since the AI pulls competitor information from online sources that may be incomplete or skewed. To address this, I treated AI outputs as guidance rather than facts and kept users in control of final pricing decisions. I was careful to limit the role of AI to avoid over-reliance. The AI does not automatically set prices, and its suggestions are meant to support thinking, not replace judgment. From an academic integrity standpoint, I was transparent about using AI tools and made sure I understood or simplified anything the AI generated rather than blindly accepting it.

The biggest surprise for me was how much oversight AI actually needs. While AI made it possible for me to build a working prototype without a coding background, it also produced confident outputs that were sometimes wrong or unsafe. This made it clear that AI is powerful, but not reliable on its own. One thing I would tell another founder is to start with clear limits. AI works best when it is used for specific tasks and treated like an uncertain input, not an authority. This project changed how I think about AI going forward. I now see it as a tool for rapid prototyping and exploration, but one that still requires careful judgment, especially when thinking about security, trust, and real-world use.
