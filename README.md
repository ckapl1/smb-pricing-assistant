# SMB Pricing Assistant  

**This README includes AI generated material that I reviewed, edited, and validated. All AI assisted content was modified to accurately reflect my implementation and full understanding of the project.**

## Overview and Goal  
The SMB Pricing Assistant is a simple AI powered tool that helps SMB owners generate data informed pricing recommendations based on cost inputs and competitor pricing. The project progressed from the initial business pitch document to a working Phase 2 prototype. The prototype demonstrates how AI can help small business owners make informed pricing decisions. Please let me know if you have any trouble opening or running the project.

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repo:  
   git clone https://github.com/ckapl1/smb-pricing-assistant.git  
   cd smb-pricing-assistant

2. Add your Gemini API key in script.js.  
3. Open index.html in your browser.  

The app runs entirely locally.

## Prototype Demo Link  
A rudimentary early version of the tool can also be tested directly through Google AI Studio at the link below:

This version demonstrates the core AI behavior behind the pricing recommendations before the full UI was developed.

## Core Features (Implemented)  
* Input fields for product name, cost, and competitor price  
* Generate price recommendation button  
* Gemini powered pricing recommendation  
* Automatic margin percentage calculation  
* Clear conversational explanation text  
* Basic frontend layout and structure  

---

## Core Features (In Progress)  
* Input validation and error handling  
* More consistent formatting across responses  
* Cleaner sensitivity table layout  
* More advanced pricing elasticity modeling  

---

## AI Specification  
AI analyzes three user inputs to produce:  
* A recommended selling price  
* A calculated margin estimate  
* A short explanation of the pricing logic  

The AI is responsible for transforming inputs into pricing guidance. Gemini is behind every part of the output except the user inputs themselves.

## Technical Architecture  
*(This section was generated with the assistance of AI and reviewed by me.)*

### Frontend  
* HTML for structure and input fields  
* JavaScript for capturing inputs, constructing prompts, calling the Gemini API, and updating the UI  
* Inline or light CSS for layout  

### AI Layer  
* Direct call to Gemini 1.5 Flash  
* Prompt includes product name, cost, and competitor price  
* AI generates pricing text and explanation  

### Computation  
* Margin percentage is calculated in JavaScript  
* Sensitivity values are generated by applying fixed percentage adjustments

## Prompting Strategy and Iteration Log  

**Initial Prompt:**  
"Given cost per unit and competitor price, recommend a selling price and explain why."  
* Returned long text answers that were hard to format  

**Follow up Prompt:**  
"Return a recommended price, margin percent, and a low/base/high pricing table. Format cleanly."  
* Produced better structure, but tone was slightly out of context  

**Follow up Prompt:**  
"Explain the pricing decision in a supportive tone for small business owners, limit to three sentences."  
* Resulted in cleaner, easier to understand explanations

## UX and Design Notes  
I wanted a simple and easy to follow user interface. I instructed Cursor to keep the layout minimal and follow common patterns seen in other SaaS tools. The goal was to create something familiar, intuitive, and fast for users.

## AI Usage Documentation  

### How AI Was Used  
Gemini analyzes three inputs (product name, cost per unit, competitor price) and returns a recommended price, margin estimate, and a short explanation. It also provides the conversational explanation text seen in the UI.

### Purpose of AI  
AI converts simple numeric inputs into clear, contextual pricing guidance. Without AI, the tool would rely only on fixed calculations rather than a more adaptive, insight driven recommendation.

### Example Prompts Used  
1. "Given the product name, cost per unit, and competitor price, recommend a fair selling price and explain the reasoning in two to three sentences."  
2. "Return the recommended price, margin percent, and a low/base/high pricing scenario table. Format the output clearly."  
3. "Explain the pricing recommendation in a supportive tone for small business owners. Keep it concise and helpful."  

### Prompt Iteration Summary  
* Early prompts were too long and unstructured  
* Structured prompts improved predictability  
* Tone instructions improved clarity and usability  
* Final prompts produce consistent, easy to parse pricing recommendations  

### Why This Level of AI Was Chosen  
The prototype only requires reasoning and explanation, not predictive modeling. Gemini 1.5 Flash is ideal for text generation and business logic reasoning at this stage.

## Academic Integrity Disclosure  
AI tools (Cursor and ChatGPT) were used to generate portions of this documentation and assist with the frontend structure. All AI generated content was reviewed, edited, and validated to ensure accuracy and full understanding. I am responsible for all final implementation decisions.

## Next Steps  
* Support for additional product types  
* Competitor comparison interface  
* Improved UI styling  
* Export or Save functionality  
* Better prompt engineering  
* More advanced pricing breakdown
